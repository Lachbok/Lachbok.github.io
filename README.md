To make a post:
 1. in the main folder, open post.txt
 2. the first line put the title of your post
 3. the following lines put the content/text of your post
 4. save the file
 5. run the makepost.py script
 6. [optional] open the index.html file in your browser to check if everything worked correctly
 7. push the changes to the GITHUB repository(may take a few minutes to actually show up)

How to run the makepost.py script:
First, open command prompt in the main folder(where makepost.py is located). 
Can do this by clicking on the file path in the folder window(the long thin rectangular strip above the folder contents), the file path will appear highlighted, delete this and type 'cmd' then press enter.
In the command prompt write 'python makepost.py' then press enter.
This will run the script and it will be done.
