<p class='posttext'>Uni is officially over, I had my last exam on friday.<br>
Once again I am excitingly filled with ideas on productive and fun ways to spend my time.<br>
Right now i'm working on making this website, which is something i've wanted to do for a long time. To have a place where I can upload and display anything anyway I want, from random thoughts to projects and anything else without worrying about who sees it, because it's mostly for myself.<br>
I also applied to a astrophysics undergrad research internship for these holidays, I really want to get accepted because it's such a cool opportunity.<br>
I hope to utilize my time to the fullest the rest of these holidays.<br>
